### Overview

"KisanSeva"  - a one-stop for Farmers of India who are facing a whole lot of issues nowadays.

The app has multiple features - 1- Secured Authentication (via OTP) 2- Multilingual for efficient use 2- Rent tools/farming essentials 3- Plant disease detection 4- Crop prediction 5- Smart connect to prevent third party person take advantage

So we built this "KisanSeva" app - a one stop for Farmers of India who are facing a whole lot issues nowadays .

App has multiple features - 
1- Secured Authentication (via OTP)
2- Multilingual for efficient use 
2- Rent tools / farming essentials
3- Plant disease detection
4- Crop prediction 
5- Smart connect to prevent third party person take advantage 
6- Know the Weather
7- Feed 
8- Toll free number/ expert assistance

### Technology used
* Google Cloud VM & AMD instances for deploying ML model
* Flutter
* Tensorflow
* Weather API
* Firebase
* Firestore
* Cloud Messaging
* Firebase Authentication
* Rest APIs
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Real-time Database


### Proposed add on features
 
To remove the issue of providing statical data in crop prediction feature we are thinking of integrating the app with an IOT model where perhaps a Node MCU model will collect all data like soil pH , Rainfall etc and send it to the real-time database and using the ML model built in the Goggle Collab we can predict the crop.
Also in Feed feature we didn't get any API which would provide news solely related to Agro industry so we are working on that.
